# Aurinkomaa theme for NodeBB

A fork of the Harmony theme for NodeBB, customized for the needs of [Aurinkomaa](https://forum.maailmanloppu.fi) forums. It mostly includes patches only to the front page of the forum.

## Changes

- Front page & categories page: Adding the name of the topic to the "lasttopic.tpl"-template, that shows latest message in a category.
- Front page: Showing child categories of a category with the icons in a very nice looking way, instead of the ugly list of Harmony.
- All pages: Showing the title of the forum only on larger devices
